## Full Stack Phonebook Application

In this part, I developed a simple backend for a phonebook application using Node.js and Express.js. The backend is connected to a MongoDB database, where the application data is stored. My phonebook application is deployed to the Fly.io platform, where the backend provides REST endpoints and serves the React frontend I developed in [part 2](../part_2/phonebook/). You can access my phonebook application [here](https://my-node-react-phonebook-app.fly.dev/).
